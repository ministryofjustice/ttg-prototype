	<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Spent convictions</h2>

		<p>For most jobs, you don’t have to disclose them, even if you’re asked to.</p>

		<p>You don’t have to disclose them when buying insurance.</p>

		<p>You might have to disclose them when travelling or working outside of England and Wales.</p>

		<p>Spent convictions remain on your record for life.

	<h2 h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Unspent convictions</h2>
		
       <p> If asked by an employer, you must disclose them.</p>

		<p>You must disclose them for insurance, mortgages, renting a house and so on.</p>

		<p>You can be prosecuted if you don’t disclose them when asked.</p>
