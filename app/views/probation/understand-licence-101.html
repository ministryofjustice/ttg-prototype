        What are licence conditions?
      </h1>  	   

	<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Purpose of release on licence</h2>

	<p>	If you were sentenced to more than 12 months but less than 4 years, you may be released early on licence.</p>
	<p> Being on licence means you’re still serving a prison sentence but you can live in the community instead of being in prison.</p> 
	<p>When you’re on licence you have to follow conditions. There are standard conditions and there may be extra conditions specific to you. If you break the rules, you’ll have to go back to prison.</p>
	<p>The licence should have been explained be to you at least one week before release. You’ll be given a copy on release. Copies are kept on your prison record and sent to the police.</p>
	<p>The licence is lawful whether you sign it or not. If you refuse to sign it, the governor will sign to confirm the conditions were read out and explained to you. </p>
	<p>If you want to complain about any additional licence conditions, speak to your supervising officer. A complaint can be considered by the Prison and Probation Ombudsman. </p>
